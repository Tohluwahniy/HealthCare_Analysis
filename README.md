#  Healthcare Data Analysis Project

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a synthetic healthcare dataset containing patient demographics, vital signs, diagnosis information, medications, and hospital admission details.

It demonstrates practical data analysis skills using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**

---

##  Project Objectives

- Clean and explore healthcare data
- Analyze patient demographics
- Visualize vital sign patterns
- Explore relationships between diagnosis and medical indicators
- Examine medication distribution and visit trends
- Generate insights useful for clinical and operational decisions

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

- **Patient Info:** Age, gender  
- **Vitals:** Heart rate, systolic & diastolic BP  
- **Diagnosis:** Common medical conditions  
- **Medications:** Drug treatments  
- **Hospital Info:** Visit date, admission status  

Dataset is synthetic and created solely for learning purposes.
